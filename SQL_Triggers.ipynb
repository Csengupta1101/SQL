    "SQL trigger has three primary events , insert , update and delete , with the help of triggers , whenever we are trying to make any of the modification in our main table with insert/update/delete , based on our given specific condition the sql query runs and our data gets stored accordingly , as an example , we can set a trigger that states if any data gets deleted from main table then the deleted data will be stored into a backup table created by us , or let's say we have given a condition that during data insertion if the salary value is somehow inserted as negative number then insert 0 insetad of the negative numbers.\n",

One way to do it is by just setting a not null constraint , but what if we don't do that. In such scenarios we will use an after insert trigger , with this trigger , everytime a null value gets inserted into that specified column a message will be generated into a separate table , let's call it messages where it will display that these records are null and values needs to be filled in.
