    "We first have to understand the use of an sql trigger. In real world data , it might happen that our data gets deleted by mistake from the main table. Suppose an entire row gets deleted from it. This creates a bigger problem as it directly affects the main table structure. To avoid such scenarios we keep a back up table. The use of this back up table is , whenever a data gets deleted from the main table , it automatically sends the deleted data into this back up table so that the data is not lost. \n",

    "And this process gets initiated with triggers. Whenever a data gets deleted , a trigger gets generated and the work of this trigger remains to push the deleted data into our back up table."
